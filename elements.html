									<h2>Intro</h2>
									<p>I am Saumyadip Bandyopadhyay, a current pre-final year undergraduate student at IIEST Shibpur, pursuing a BTech in Mechanical Engineering. Though I come from a core branch still I take a keen interest and enthusiasm in the software development domain, and also have a passion for game development.I am an efficient problem solver and has firm knowledge on data structures and algorithms and has solved 300+ problems on various online coding platforms including leetcode,codechef,codeforces. I have gained proficiency in game development libraries such as Pygame for Python and SFML for C++, and I have completed a few projects in this field to gain practical knowledge.

										Apart from these, I am an enthusiast of Machine Learning. I have undertaken various projects involving supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as deep learning using MNIST datasets on Jupyter Notebook. Currently, I am delving into Reinforcement Learning and its applications in diverse fields like gaming, cybersecurity, microbots, and traffic. I have worked on deep reinforcement learning models utilizing the OpenAI Gym environment.
										
										In addition to my academic pursuits, I am engaged in a research project under the guidance of one of my professors. This project focuses on Osteoarthritis detection using various Machine Learning techniques, which allows me to apply my knowledge to real-world problems.
										
										I possess a strong foundational knowledge of engineering mathematics, including Calculus, Linear Algebra, Statistics, Probability, Series, and number theory, which I have acquired through my coursework. As a self-motivated individual, I am actively seeking opportunities that are best suited to my skills and abilities, where I can apply my knowledge in a hands-on manner within industries. Besides, I am a bookworm and loves to read about engineering,technology and science and their rapid progress in everyday life.</p>
